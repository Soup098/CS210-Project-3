Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The purpose of this project was to create a program that reads the input from a file, in this case a list of produce items, and output quantity of items based on user input.
  
What did you do particularly well?
  I think my execution of the functions for the different menu items were good.
  
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I still dont have a strong understanding of the best way to utilize class constructors. in this case i put the opening of the file directly in the class constructor because it could access the private map member. 
  
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  I had to dive into how maps worked a lot to understand how to add file items to it and then access them.
  
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  classes classes classes! I did not use pointers however and I would like to learn much more about those and their purpose.
  
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  by creating classes and utilizing member functions.
